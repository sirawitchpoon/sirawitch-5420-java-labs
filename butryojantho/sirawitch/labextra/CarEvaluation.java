/**
* This is CarEvaluation program.
* It's takes userâ€™s evaluations from the standard input, and then calculates 
* and displays an average score for each category being evaluated to the standard output.
* A car is evaluated in five categories: Appearance, Braking, Comfort, Handling, and Reliability.
* For each category, a score of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 will be used, 
* where 1 represents the lowest possible score, and 5 represents the highest possible score.
* The program starts by calling the function getEvaluations() to get inputs from the user. 
* The program first asks the user how many submissions he/she wants to enter.
* Then, for each submission, the program asks the user to enter a score for each category in the same line 
* Which in the order of Appearance, Braking, Comfort, Handling, and Reliability respectively.  
* After the program finishes obtaining inputs from the user, the program calls the function displayStats().
* In the function, displayStats(), for each evaluated category, 
* the program calculates the average score in that category, and displays the results to the user.

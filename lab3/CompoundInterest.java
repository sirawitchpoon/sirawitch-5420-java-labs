/** CompoundInterest Program
* The program has the following properties:
* a) The program read in two doubles: initialInvest and interest. 
* b) The program displays each year the total investment until the total is twice the initial money invested. 
* c) The total investment each year can be computed from the previous yearâ€™s investment plus the additional income from interest. 
*    (current invest = previous investment + interest*previous investment). 
* d) All output numbers should be displayed with 2 digit precision.
* e) The program outputs an error message when either initialInvest or interest, or both are negative
